# Plotly-Challenge - Belly Button Biodiversity

For this assignment, I was directed to build an interactive dashboard to explore the 

[Belly Button Biodiversity dataset](http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/), which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.

The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

## Plotly

1. Used the D3 library to read in `samples.json`.

2. Created a horizontal bar chart with a dropdown menu to display the top 10 OTU's found in that individual.

3. Created a bubble chart that displays each sample.

4. Displayed the sample metadata (individual's demographic info).

5.  Displayed each key-value pair from the metadata JSON object somewhere on the page.

6. Update all of the plots anytime a new sample is selected.

## Deployment

* Deployed app to Github Pages
